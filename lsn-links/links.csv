Our approach is to build strategic partnerships with trust, transparency and fair working practices across the board.

Early on we established a culture of frank dialogue. 

Our “cards on the table” approach not only builds trust but helps mitigate operational risk and team stress. There’s no dancing around key concerns or cultural differences. We simply lay it all out on the table and talk about it. 

In saying that, we still take security seriously and follow regulatory best practises within an operational and contractual infrastructure perfected to safeguard the interests of all parties’.

So Mudit established this community of Artists, a safer place where Mudit support, appreciates, motivates and inspires artists to be the real them. ARTISTIC_BYNATURE organizes events for artists to give them platform to explore and complete. They have collaborated with more than 1000+ events in this shot span of 1 year nationally and internationally.

I started my journey of entrepreneurship on my engineering days when I was struggling with my semester exams and started working on a startup with my friend ( Social Bazaar). We were taking providing local shops an online platform to sell & advertise and also the customers shopping with ease from home, locally.

Back then we raised it to 5 cities but as the story of most of the entrepreneurs, we were unable to expand it globally.
However, failures didn’t stop me from experimenting and trying new things.
We were the finalist of Startup India Yatra.
Got many awards & certificates.
But there's a strong bond with my first startup which kept me going and started freelance Digital Marketing and from there I got a breakthrough, Started an agency working with clients of Education Niche ( Trainers, Coaches, Educational Institutes, etc) 
With results, I'm able to scale up & the results got me to ""35UNDER35 Best Digital Marketer in M.P."" 
working with some big names in the industry and now heading towards Personal Brand.

Till now I've been featured in ""Entrepreneurs Of India"", ""Dainik Bhaskar"", ""Startup College""
